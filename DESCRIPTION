Description: Routines that allow the user to run a large number of goodness-of-fit tests.  
     It allows for data to be continuous or discrete. It includes routines to estimate
     the power of the tests and display them as a power graph.
     The routine run.studies allows a user to quickly study the power of a new method and 
     how it compares to some of the standard ones.
